## 🔧 Key Implementation Details

### Two-Phase Verification Strategy
```
Phase 1: Immediate (0-15 min, every 3 seconds)
├── Triggered by /verify endpoint
├── High-frequency checks for fast confirmation
└── Stops when confirmed or 15 minutes elapsed

Phase 2: Background (15 min - 24 hours, every 1 hour)
├── Cron job for delayed payments
├── Lower-frequency checks for edge cases
└── Continues until confirmed or expired

Phase 3: Expiration (After 24 hours)
├── Mark as PAYOUT_FAILED
├── Send expiration email
└── User contacts support if needed
```

### Verification Endpoint
```typescript
POST /api/v1/transactions/:reference/verify
Headers: { admin, adminpwd }
Body: {
  senderName, senderPhone, senderEmail,
  currency, txid, paymentType, amount,
  successUrl, paymentLinkId
}
```

### Atomic Transaction Updates
```typescript
// Prevents race conditions between phases
const updatedTransaction = await Transaction.findOneAndUpdate(
  { _id: transaction._id, state: TransactionState.PENDING },
  { $set: { state: TransactionState.PAID, ... } },
  { new: true }
);
```

### Database Indexes
```javascript
// Optimized queries for verification phases
{ state: 1, verificationStartedAt: 1 }  // Immediate phase filtering
{ state: 1, expiresAt: 1 }              // Background phase filtering
{ lastVerificationCheck: 1 }            // Verification timing
```

## 🚀 Service Management

### Starting Services
```bash
npm start  # Automatically starts both phases
```

### Environment Configuration
```env
# Toronet API (existing)
TORONET_ADMIN=your_admin_address
TORONET_ADMIN_PWD=your_admin_password

# Email Service (existing)
SMTP_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
SMTP_PORT=587
SMTP_USER=your-email@gmail.com
SMTP_PASS=your-app-password
SMTP_FROM=noreply@chainpaye.com
SUPPORT_EMAIL=support@chainpaye.com
```

### Testing Commands
```bash
# Full immediate verification test
node test-immediate-verification.js

# Monitor background verification
node test-immediate-verification.js monitor

# Check service status
node test-immediate-verification.js status
```

## 📊 Verification Logic

### Immediate Phase Selection
```javascript
// Starts when /verify endpoint called
// Runs for 15 minutes maximum
// 3-second intervals for fast feedback
```

### Background Phase Selection
```javascript
// Finds transactions for hourly verification
{
  state: 'PENDING',
  expiresAt: { $gt: new Date() },
  toronetReference: { $exists: true, $ne: null },
  verificationStartedAt: { $lt: fifteenMinutesAgo }
}
```

### Toronet API Integration
```javascript
POST https://www.toronet.org/api/payment/toro/
{
  "op": "recordfiattransaction",
  "params": [
    { "name": "currency", "value": "USD" },
    { "name": "txid", "value": "toro_ref_123" },
    { "name": "paymenttype", "value": "card" }
  ]
}
```

## 🛡️ Error Handling & Race Conditions

### Atomic Updates
- Uses `findOneAndUpdate` with state condition to prevent duplicate processing
- Returns null if another process already handled the transaction
- Ensures only one process can confirm a transaction

### Graceful Error Handling
- **Toronet API errors**: Log and continue with other transactions
- **Email failures**: Log but don't block confirmation flow
- **Webhook failures**: Log but don't block confirmation flow
- **Database errors**: Log and may halt processing to prevent corruption

### Phase Coordination
- Immediate verification stops when transaction state changes
- Background verification skips transactions already processed
- Both phases check current state before making updates

## 📈 Performance Optimizations

### Efficient Querying
```javascript
// Compound indexes for optimal performance
{ state: 1, verificationStartedAt: 1, expiresAt: 1 }
{ toronetReference: 1 }
{ lastVerificationCheck: 1 }
```

### Resource Management
- Immediate verification uses `setInterval` with automatic cleanup
- Background verification uses single cron job for all transactions
- Memory-efficient transaction processing with proper cleanup

### API Rate Management
- Immediate: 3-second intervals (20 calls per minute per transaction)
- Background: 1-hour intervals (24 calls per day per transaction)
- Prevents API spam while ensuring timely confirmation

## 🔐 Security Considerations

### Admin Authentication
- Verification endpoint requires admin credentials in headers
- Validates against environment variables
- Prevents unauthorized verification attempts

### Data Validation
- Comprehensive request body validation
- Transaction state verification before processing
- Proper error messages without sensitive data exposure

### Webhook Security
- Uses HTTPS endpoints for webhook calls
- Includes proper headers and user agent
- Timeout protection against hanging requests
